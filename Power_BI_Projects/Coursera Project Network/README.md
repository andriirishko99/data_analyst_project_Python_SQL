# Data Analyst Project

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This repository showcases my Power BI project, centred around dynamic data analysis and visualization using Microsoft Power BI. This project underscores my proficiency in data transformation, interactive report creation, and extracting meaningful insights from datasets.

### Steps involved in the project:
- __Data Import and preprocessing data__ <br>
Import the dataset into Microsoft Power BI and preprocess it effectively. This involved addressing column name issues, structuring the data, and ensuring its accuracy for subsequent analysis.
- __Data Transformation and Analysis__ <br>
Explore various data transformation techniques, effectively cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- __Data Visualization__ <br>
Create visually appealing charts and graphs using Power BI to represent the analyzed data effectively.
- __Comprehensive Analysis__ <br>
In-depth examination of credit card default data using Power BI Desktop. It encompasses exploring default rates based on education levels, investigating default patterns across various states and regions, and calculating the defaulter ratio.

By harnessing the capabilities of Power BI, this project empowers you to efficiently delve into datasets, uncover hidden patterns, and gain a comprehensive understanding of your data. Power BI's robust features for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis make it an indispensable tool for data analysts.
